# How to use

- npm install
- npm run check
- npm run build

We have used a module called npx in order to call the reference modules, so please install **npx** beforehand globally using:

- npm install -g npx

1. **npm run check**
	This checks against the possible wrong references with respect to the datatypes you mentioned.
1. **npm run build**
	This will remove all the refrences of flow and make the code exectuable since type refrences are not possible in **.js** files.
